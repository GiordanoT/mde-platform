The designed system aims to support the principles and practices of Model Driven Engineering (MDE). The builded system enables users to create 1 metamodel (M2) and 1 model (M1) that conforms to the defined metamodel. By operating within the MDE paradigm, the platform facilitates the development of domain specific modeling solutions, empowering users to define custom metamodels composed of packages, classes, and attributes. Additionally, the platform enables the instantiation of defined meta-classes consisting of objects and associated values, promoting higher abstraction and efficiency in system design and development.
